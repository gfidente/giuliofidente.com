I've been there and thought it was a very well organized event, in a nice location. Every minute together with peers seemed worth it to me. This said, let's talk about the actual sessions. I spent most of my time at the TripleO and Heat sessions, with a little detour on Magnum. Plus some booth crawling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TripleO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;We had three sessions and a full day meetup. The first discussed the recent work done to allow for the deployment of OpenStack in containers, using TripleO; the changes to deploy the compute nodes and a majority of the controller roles in containers are up for review, which is great; some notes can be found in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tripleo-mitaka-containers"&gt;tripleo-mitaka-containers&lt;/a&gt; pad. It was very nice for me to see the TripleO bits delivering on the promise of being flexibile; deploying in containers requires minimal changes to the core tools and yet inherits important features like network isolation and support for Ceph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another session was on upgrades, which isn't a trivial goal as it pushes on both Heat and Puppet. The proposed plan is to start with a CI job attempting to upgrade an overcloud from the stable branch to the master branch; more in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tripleo-kilo-to-liberty-upgrades"&gt;tripleo-kilo-to-liberty-upgrades&lt;/a&gt; pad. I will hopefully write more about this topic in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has also been a session on the CLI and UI clients. Again, not a simple problem because the Heat templates are constantly ongoing refactor to implement new features and because putting too much business logic into the client limited our flexibility in the past. We'll probably see a shared library for the newer CLI/UI, with less business logic and probably a REST API, more in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tripleo-mitaka-restapi"&gt;tripleo-mitaka-restapi&lt;/a&gt; pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Then the community meetup on Friday covered a few additional topics. We reviewed the status of the CI with ideas for more jobs, discussed some ideas to provision the puppet modules via Heat instead of shipping them with the images, collected lots of good feedback from actual OpenStack operators and, last but not least, discussed the recent work from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dprince/"&gt;Dan Prince&lt;/a&gt; to have composable roles. Kudos to Dan on the composable roles which also seems to work pretty well with the effort to containerize the deployment. Notes about the community meetup are in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tripleo-mitaka-meetup"&gt;tripleo-mitaka-meetup&lt;/a&gt; pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;I've joined only those sessions were I could at least understand the topics and yet there is quite a lot to write about. First an interesting session focused on a problem with dependencies across nested stacks, which we make large us of in TripleO. Both the issue and the consequences are much easier to understand with a picture than with words. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.zerobanana.com/"&gt;Zane Bitter&lt;/a&gt; had indeed prepared some &lt;em&gt;demo&lt;/em&gt; material for the session, including pictures, which should be linked from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/mitaka-heat-break-stack-barrier"&gt;mitaka-heat-break-stack-barrier&lt;/a&gt; pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a session to discuss issues affecting large stack deployments. Major points for discussion were of three types: token timeouts, batching of operations and resources status polling, with resources polling being probably the hardest to cope with. More in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/mitaka-heat-large-stacks"&gt;mitaka-heat-large-stacks&lt;/a&gt; pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a session to collect input from users and ops. My proposal here was for the introduction of 'immutable resources' where resources with such a proerty wouldn't get deleted or updated during a stack update. One proposed solution for this is a warning message, outputted by the stack validation process, in case of resources deletion. More on this and on the session in general in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/mitaka-heat-user-ops"&gt;mitaka-heat-user-ops&lt;/a&gt; pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;There has also been an interesting conversation about the changes from a spec meant to introduce support for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/heat-specs/specs/liberty/external_resource.html"&gt;external resources&lt;/a&gt;, which is something TripleO could use soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The Magnum project seems to be facing some of the problems which TripleO faced in past as well, in relation to the Heat templates. The goal seems to be to customize the templates based on the input parameters; I joined the session to learn more about the Magnum approach and the proposed solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;It seems to me that while TripleO relies on actual Heat features to allow for different implementations of the same resource, via resource registry, Magnum is working instead on a sort of pre-processor (powered by Jinja) which generates Heat templates using conditionals and includes from the Jinja language. More on this is in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/magnum/+bug/1501045"&gt;launchpad bug 1501045&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who said installers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;It was nice to see TripleO mentioned in at least two more sessions, one where Mirantis directly compared Fuel to the Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director and another where &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://openstacksummitoctober2015tokyo.sched.org/event/7032267fad9f6f0e5242093d17d59d64"&gt;four different automated installers were reviewed&lt;/a&gt;. Each had its moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I think one good thing about TripleO is that it is pretty flexible and offers some capabilities to maintain the environment even after the initial installation; hopefully both will make it interesting to many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDO meetup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We had a meetup for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rdoproject.org/"&gt;RDO&lt;/a&gt; project and it cleared up a lot of questions on how the packages are built and tested for both the trunk and the stable branches. Good news is that users should be able now to try TripleO, on CentOS, with the latest RDO bits.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what about the event? Well, as an ATC, I have two things to say about the event more in general. First, &lt;strong&gt;I'd really like the design summit to start on Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;. Simply put, there are so many sessions going on that it is impossible to join anything out of the most immediate interests. My thinking is that one more day could at least lower parallelism!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another comment is, please &lt;strong&gt;make the keynotes a little less marketish&lt;/strong&gt;. I know the circus runs on actual money but my feeling is that the keynotes, on both Tuesday and Wednesday, left some sessions go a little too far into the product marketing area when they were probably supposed to present an actual OpenStack use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="OpenStack summit Ticket" class="align-center" src="http://giuliofidente.com/images/ticket_os2015.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, it was great to have some time to meet face to face peers and coworkers from all over the world. Including some who are &lt;em&gt;not exactly&lt;/em&gt; peers, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthicksj"&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt;, to whom I ended up asking if he was a newcome to the TripleO project during dinner. I'm sure next time I will remember and do better.&lt;/p&gt;

The event was very well organized and even the food was good. The following are the talks I attended with some comments and my takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu"&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; 2013 lasting a full week, including the weekend with some code sprints, I could only join the event for three days, from Tuesday to Thursday. Still it was a great experience and a good chance to learn about new things while also meet people who I only knew because of IRC, by their nicknames. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/schedule/ep2013/"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; was quite tight though and there were talks in all five rooms at the same time, making it difficult to join all the talks I wanted. This is the best I could came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see OpenStack in your future!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Being a stacker, I couldn't miss this. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://muharem.wordpress.com/"&gt;Muharem&lt;/a&gt; gave some overview of the components for newcomers but mainly the talk was a discussion around the project surroundings, the community, the developments. I think it was very good even for knowledgeable. Almost 300 single contributors for Grzzily with Red Hat currently at the top of the list and IBM saying the community is growing by the trends seen for Linux, only at ten times the speed!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to OpenStack Swift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Again, I couldn't miss this. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.chmouel.com/"&gt;Chmouel&lt;/a&gt; works on Swift from some time now and during the speech gave some insights on its internals, with the &lt;cite&gt;ring&lt;/cite&gt; being the most interesting thing to me. It basically keeps track of where all data resides pointing to the particular device on the particular physical node. After the talk I even had a chance to talk more to him and go trough some ideas/guidelines to scale all the core OpenStack components, not just Swift. This was enlightening and pointed us to a few must have: regions, database replicas, good network connectivity.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marconi: Queuing and Notification service for OpenStack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An interesting talk about the incubated component called Marconi, which aims at introducing support for Queuing and Notifications in OpenStack, as per Amazon's SQS and SNS services. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.flaper87.org/"&gt;Flavio&lt;/a&gt; did a great job in showing why, while still in its early days, Marconi with the current MongoDB storage driver implementation, is going to bring into the core group a component well designed for scalability from day one. The team is small and looking for contributors but the project adds an important piece to the OpenStack puzzle; I look forward to put my hands on it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to machine learning using Python tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The room was full. Not only that, some were standing on their feets for all the 50mins. I had some previous exposure to the machine learning concepts thanks to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml"&gt;Machine Learning Class&lt;/a&gt; from Coursera but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://shankar.bigbig.com/"&gt;Satish&lt;/a&gt; went trough a recap of all those and also introduced a few python tools showing some of their capabilities by using real world data! There are very good tools around with sickit-learn being probably one of the most complete but, for their correct usage, one needs to &lt;cite&gt;know&lt;/cite&gt; the data. I see me digging a bit further into the clustering algorithms as soon as a good occasion pops up. This was a very well structured talk with many ways out for all the people attending I suppose.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will iPython replace bash?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I wonder why it took me so much time to hear about iPython! &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vaunaspada.babel.it/"&gt;Roberto&lt;/a&gt; (a former colleague of mine) jokingly invited people to use iPython as an actual shell in place of the regular bash. Actually, in the cloud era, while we move from pets to cattle and have to deal with so many systems at once, having a more manageable, portable and reliable way to write &lt;cite&gt;scripts&lt;/cite&gt; is important and python fits very well into the purpose. iPython seems a perfect complimentary.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenlet-based concurrency&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Taming greenlets using eventlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I had to face threads in python when trying to parallelize the execution of some long running tests. The experience was okay but later I told myself I should have tried greenlet. Both these talks were the perfect occasion to learn more about it. Also, the eventlet tutorial / code snippet online makes it very appealing but the talk gave a lot of insights on how the underlying code works. This monkey_patch thing for instance seems the way to go for pre-existing code but people was descouraged from using it for anything which can be quickly refactored. The thing is, greenlet make you run lighter; eventlet make the code easy to maintain and more efficient thanks to the &lt;cite&gt;switch when needed&lt;/cite&gt; concept. The two combined are for the good of the most common parallelization use cases. Kudos to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goranperetin.com/"&gt;Goran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://devork.be/"&gt;Floris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenStack on OpenStack: Deploying OpenStack using OpenStack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This TripleO thing was known to me but never had the chance to try it out. The fact that it uses Heat makes it easily extensible and definitely an interesting educational project for me but I still don't see many real world cases for it. Given that both the underlying (bare) and upper layer configuration may vary a lot, I expect a number bits and pieces to require some manual set up anyway. In addition to that a state management system, like Salt, is also needed for post deployment management. Still this pushes around the edges of what is possible to automate today.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;img alt="EuroPython Ticket" class="align-right" src="http://giuliofidente.com/images/ticket_ep2013.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to attend a 1 hour long session of lightning talks too, a nice experience. I wanted to provide some links to an awesome project discussed in that occasion, a mobile app aimed at helping mute people communicate, providing icons and language processing facilities. Unfortunately I don't seem to find any reference to it online! :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing, amongst the gadgets given to the participants there was a very good one, a book: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python3porting.com/"&gt;Porting to Python 3&lt;/a&gt;. You can read it for free online but having it printed is very convenient. I found the book a good pick and a very useful read, given the in-depth details which are discussed in only a few pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, next year the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu"&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; will be held in Berlin! The only unfortunate thing for this year event were some problems with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2013.europython.eu/blog/2013/05/20/enjoy-your-evenings"&gt;PyBarbecue&lt;/a&gt;, due probably to too many people joining.&lt;/p&gt;
