The event was well organized and the food was good. This is a short write down around the &lt;cite&gt;track&lt;/cite&gt; I followed there and about my takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu"&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; 2013 lasting a full week, including the weekend with code sprints, I could only join the event for three days, from Tuesday to Thursday. Still it was a great experience and also a chance to learn about new things and meet people who I only knew because of IRC, by their nicknames. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/schedule/ep2013/"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; was quite tight though and there were talks in all five rooms at the same time but here is the best I could came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see OpenStack in your future!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Being a stacker, I couldn't miss this. Muharem gave some overview of the components for newcomers but mainly the talk was a discussion around the project surroundings, the community, the developments. I think it was very good even for knowledgeable. Almost 300 contributors for Grzzily with Red Hat currently contributing the most and IBM saying the community growing resembles the trends seen for Linux, only at ten times the speed!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to OpenStack Swift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Again, I couldn't miss this. Chmouel works on Swift from very long time now and gave some insights on its internals with the &lt;cite&gt;ring&lt;/cite&gt; being the most interesting thing to me. It basically keeps track of where all data resides pointing to the particular device on the particular physical node. After the talk I had a chance to talk more to him and we went trough some ideas for a scaling model roughly applicable to all the core OpenStack components, not just Swift. Was very interesting and helpful and elightened a few musts: regions, database replicas, good network connectivity.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marconi: Queuing and Notification service for OpenStack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;An interesting talk about the incubated component called Marconi which aims at introducing support for Queuing and Notification in OpenStack as per Amazon's SQS and SNS services. I knew Flavio and could focus on the contents. While still in its early days, Marconi, with the current MongoDB storage driver implementation, seems to me to be bringing into the core group a component well designed for scalability from day one. The team is small and looking for contributors but the project is really going to add an important piece to the OpenStack puzzle; looking forward to put my hands on it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to machine learning using Python tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;The room was full. Not only that, some were standing on their feets for all the 50mins. I had some previous exposure to the machine learning concepts thanks to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml"&gt;Machine Learning Class&lt;/a&gt; from Coursera and Satish went trough a fast recap of those plus he introduced a few python tools for practical use and even show some of their capabilities using real world data! There are very good tools around with sickit-learn being probably one of the most complete but, for their correct usage, one needs to &lt;cite&gt;know&lt;/cite&gt; the data. I see me digging a bit further into the clustering algorithms as soon as a good occasion pops up. This was a very well structured talk with many ways out for all the people there attending I suppose.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will ipython replace bash?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I wonder why it took me so much time to hear about iPython! Roberto (a former colleague of mine) was pushing this forward showing people how to use iPython as an actual shell in place of the more regular bash. In the cloud era were we move from pets to cattle and have to deal with so many systems at once, having a more manageable, portable and reliable way to write &lt;cite&gt;scripts&lt;/cite&gt; is getting important and python fits very well into the purpose. iPython seems a perfect complimentary.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greenlet-based concurrency&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Taming greenlets using eventlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I had to face threads in python when trying to parallelize the execution of some long running tests. The experience was okay but later I told myself I should have tried greenlet. Both these talks were the perfect occasion to learn more about it. The eventlet tutorial / code snippet online makes it very appealing and the talk gave a lot of insights on how the underlying code works. This monkey_patch thing seems the way to go for pre-existing code but people was descouraged from using it for anything which can be quickly refactored. The thing is, greenlet make you run lighter with eventlet making the code easy to maintain and more efficient thanks to the &lt;cite&gt;switch when needed&lt;/cite&gt; concept. Combining the two makes perfect sense in the most common parallelization use cases.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenStack on OpenStack: Deploying OpenStack using OpenStack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;This TripleO thing was known to me but never took the chance to try it out. The fact that it uses Heat makes the project easily extensible so this is definitely an interesting educational project to me but I still miss to see many real use cases for it, especially considering that both the underlying and upper layer topologies and configurations may vary so much that many bits and pieces around will always have to be set up manually. Still it pushes around the edges of what is possible to automate today.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to attend some 1 hour long session of lightning talks too, a nice experience. I wanted to provide some links to an awesome project discussed there, some mobile app aimed at helping mute people communicate providing icons and language processing facilities but unfortunately can't find any reference to it online! :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing, amongst the gadgets given to the participants there was a very good one, a book: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python3porting.com/"&gt;Porting to Python 3&lt;/a&gt;. You can read it for free online but having it printed is very convenient. I found the book a very good pick and a very useful read, given the in-depth details which are discussed in only a few pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, next year the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://europython.eu"&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; will be held in Berlin! The only unfortunate thing for this year event was that there have been some problems with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://ep2013.europython.eu/blog/2013/05/20/enjoy-your-evenings"&gt;PyBarbecue&lt;/a&gt;, probably simply because of too many people joining.&lt;/p&gt;
